# Weather-app-react

## The project
This is a simple weather app where the user can type in the name of a city and some information about the weather will show 

## Goals of this project
The main goal of this project was to get api calls working in react 

## what was learnt 
I learnt a bit about hooks, predominantly the useeffect hook. This allowed me to make api calls when necessary.
